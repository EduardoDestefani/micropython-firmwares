Repository of personalized firmware.

## Installation of Firmwares in Pyboard D-Series
To know how to install the repository firmware, just run such commands with pyboard-d in "DFU" mode. The command below must be executed in the same directory where the pydfu.py and 'firmware.dfu' files are:

`sudo python3 pydfu.py -u firmware_name.dfu`

## Construction of the ulab firmwares for pyboard boards
In Debian and derivatives the gcc-arm is very old (5.x) in the official repository. So manually install GCC-ARM current, follow ["Getting Started STM"](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/Getting-Started-STM). The chosen version was the [gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads).

Add to the end of the file .bashrc (execute `sudo nano ~/.bashrc`):

`export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/stm/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2020-q2-update/bin"`

Other dependencies are required, it is recommended to install one by one, and then perform a `sudo apt-get update`. Then, run:

```
sudo apt-get install git

sudo apt-get install build-essential 

sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev 

sudo apt-get install libffi-dev 

sudo apt-get install pkg-config
```
Compiling MicroPython Mainline for [Unix/Linux](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/Getting-Started):

* With git and gcc compiler installed, choose a directory and run the commands:

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/micropython/micropython
$ cd micropython
$ git submodule update --init
$ cd mpy-cross && make clean && make -j8
$ ./mpy-cross --version
$ cd ../ports/unix && make clean && make -j8 submodules && make -j8
$ ./micropython
     MicroPython v1.12-649-g27767aafa on 2020-08-10; linux version
     Use Ctrl-D to exit, Ctrl-E for paste mode
     >>>
```

### 1. Compiling micropython/ports/stm32 (for pyboard boards, etc.)
We chose [Pyboard-D SF2 board](https://store.micropython.org/product/PYBD-SF2-W4F2), defined in `micropython/ports/stm32/boards/PYBD_SF2`, such that `BOARD=PYBD_SF2`.
But there are other official micropython boards such as Pyboard V1.1 (PYBV11), Pyboard Lite v1.0 (PYBLITEV10), Pyboard-D SF3 (PYBD_SF3) and Pyboard-D SF6 (PYBD_SF6), Espruino Pico (ESPRUINO_PICO), etc. As well as several STM32 boards with micropython defined by the community, but less surface, fewer resources running, less stable.

After performing the steps of [~/stm e gcc-arm](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/Getting-Started-STM#linux-general), enter the directory `ports/stm32`:
```
(base) eduardo@eduardo:~/micropython$ cd ports/stm32
```
It is necessary to compile submodules from `stm32` only in 1st time after downloading or updating the micropython source code:
```
(base) eduardo@eduardo:~/micropython/ports/stm32$ make -j8 submodules
    Use make V=1 or set BUILD_VERBOSE in your environment to increase build verbosity.
    Updating submodules: lib/lwip lib/mbedtls lib/mynewt-nimble lib/stm32lib
```
#### 1.1. Creating Firmware for Pyboard-D SF2 with default configuration (FP32, without threads)
The 'make clean' from the board it is recommended to need every time you create firmware, otherwise it generates very difficult errors to understand, then always use `make clean` of the micropython plate before `make` main:  
```
(base) eduardo@eduardo:~/micropython/ports/stm32$ make BOARD=PYBD_SF2 clean
    Use make V=1 or set BUILD_VERBOSE in your environment to increase build verbosity.
    rm -rf build-PYBD_SF2
```
Compiling and creating firmware, spend a few minutes: 
```
(base) eduardo@eduardo:~/micropython/ports/stm32$ make -j8 BOARD=PYBD_SF2
    ...
    LINK build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.elf
       text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
    1000692	    340	  75860	1076892	 106e9c	build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.elf
    INFO: this build requires mboot to be installed first
    INFO: this build places firmware in external QSPI flash
    GEN build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.dfu
    GEN build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.hex
```
#### 1.1.2. Creating firmware for Pyboard-D SF2 with FP64 configuration, without threads

To create double precision firmware (FP64) for floating-point numbers, see [MicroPython v1.12 firmwares for Pyboard v1.1/Lite v1.0/D SF2/D SF3/D SF6 - Optional) Building firmware with 'make' options](https://gitlab.com/rcolistete/micropython-firmwares/-/tree/master/Pyboard/v1.12/2020-07-26#optional-building-firmware-with-make-options), That is, repeat 1.1., however in the `make` command add the `MICROPY_FLOAT_IMPL=double` option:
```
(base) eduardo@eduardo:~/micropython/ports/stm32$ make -j8 MICROPY_FLOAT_IMPL=double BOARD=PYBD_SF2
    ...
    LINK build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.elf
       text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
    1013476	    340	  75860	1089676	 10a08c	build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.elf
    INFO: this build requires mboot to be installed first
    INFO: this build places firmware in external QSPI flash
    GEN build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.dfu
    GEN build-PYBD_SF2/firmware.hex
```

#### 1.1.3. Compiling the [**ulab**](https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab#ulab) in MicroPython firmware for Pyboard-D SF2

For this command it is necessary that the ulab git clone:

`(base) erosvatis@nucleon-Inspiron-3583:~$ git clone https://github.com/v923z/micropython-ulab.git ulab`

From there we had the memory problem of Pyboard-D SF2-3 to support the ulab in the internal flash. However, in the MicroPython forum, we have another solution published by a user in the ulab topic, "or what you will - numpy on bare metal". We added the line 51 of `micropython/ports/stm32/boards/PYBD_SF2/f722_qspi.ld`:

`*code/*(.text* .rodata*)`

Then, in the directory `~/micropython/ports/stm32`, we execute such command below to build the firmware MicroPython + ulab:

`make -j8 BOARD=PYBD_SF2 USER_C_MODULES=../../../ulab all`

To compile with double precision DP/FP64, execute:

`make -j8 MICROPY_FLOAT_IMPL=double BOARD=PYBD_SF2 USER_C_MODULES=../../../ulab all`

Make sure that there was compilation of the ulab module in the terminal compile log:

```
Use make V=1 or set BUILD_VERBOSE in your environment to increase build verbosity.

`git pull`
